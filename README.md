# Short-Number-Class

This program allows the user to create an object and assign a number to it. They can then add, subtract, multiply and divide that number using the member functions in the Short.cpp file.  All declarations are in the Short.h file and all tests are done within the ShortMain.cpp file.  The makefile compiles everything in linux into one executable main file.
